# ARCO ABITI DA SPOSA

# INTRODUCTION

This project is part of an academic assessment for the "Information and Technology Skills" course in the Master's program "Language, Society, and Communication" at the University of Bologna.

Our project focuses on analyzing and using knowledge graphs from ARCO and Large Language Models, The selected ARCO ontology was about clothing description. 

GOAL: to explore the characteristics of wedding dresses that are cataloged in the clothing description ontology. In particular, we focused on the materials and creators. After gathering information on these two elements, we decided to choose the creator Germana Marucelli as the focal point for the second part of our project. 

Germana Marucelli was an influential Italian fashion designer known for her innovative and elegant designs and she played a key role in establishing Italy as a global fashion hub.  

In the following parts you will have information about the methodology, results and analysis, discussion, conclusion and possible future developments.

# DISCUSSION

|:-------------|:------------------|
| dc:type abito da sposa showed a few results because it is too specific. | Filtering the results to obtain more. | 
| LLM answers were very general and vague on knowledge. Gemini sometimes did not showed results. | Provide more information and use more prompting techniques. | 
| Understand how to use Github to create an intuitive and userfriendly website. | Collectively trying with different templates as well as getting external feedback about the design.|
